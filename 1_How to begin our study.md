## How to begin our study of data analysis
Data analysis is used to solve the questions, rather than 'analyzing to analyze'. We are going to focus on the following four questions in this course:
- how can we have KPI grow via analyzing data;
- how to complete the SQL tasks;
- how do we comprehense the system of data analysis rather than its fragments;
- how can we capture the aim of your boss ;)

We are going to study data analysis via 7 sections:
1. Data thinking 数据思维;
2. Professional knowledge 业务知识;
3. Excel;
4. Data visualization;
5. SQL;
6. Statistics;
7. Python.
